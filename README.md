## Hi there, I'm Arsham
An electrical engineer with a background in control systems and a passion for embedded systems. I focus on circuit and PCB design, working with both 8-bit AVR microcontrollers (using Arduino and CodeVision AVR) and 32-bit STM32 devices.

Currently, I contribute my expertise to the R&D department at Safety Parts Manufacturing Co. (SPM), a division of IKCo, where weâ€™re pushing the boundaries of car audio systems. When I'm off the clock, I love exploring new trends in electronics on YouTube and even diving into the basics of AI.

Letâ€™s innovate together and explore the future of technology!
